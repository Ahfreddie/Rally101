      <h1>Rallying 101</h1>
      <p>
        Rallying is one of the most thrilling and demanding forms of motorsport,
        combining speed, skill, and strategy across unpredictable terrains. From
        its humble beginnings as endurance runs through the countryside to
        today&apos;s high-tech world of the World Rally Championship, rallying
        has evolved into a spectacle of precision driving and mechanical
        excellence. This compilation explores three defining aspects of the
        sport — its rich history, the engineering marvels behind the machines,
        and the spirit of drivers who push the limits in pursuit of victory.

        <h2>History of Rally</h2>
        <p>
          The journey through rally history traces how drivers once navigated
          rugged roads and shifting weather using pure skill and wit. From early
          endurance tests across unpaved tracks to the high-stakes era of
          turbo-charged monsters and championship mayhem, rallying evolved into
          a global spectacle where speed met strategy and terrain refused to be
          tamed.

        <h2>Engineering behind Rally Machines</h2>
        <p>
          Behind every roaring rally car lies a blend of innovation and
          toughness. Built to endure harsh terrains, these machines balance
          power, agility, and durability — from reinforced suspensions and
          turbocharged engines to intelligent all-wheel-drive systems. Every
          bolt and design choice serves one purpose: to keep the car fast,
          stable, and unshaken no matter how wild the course gets.

        <h2>The Spirit of the Driver</h2>
        <p>
          Rallying is more than cars and competition — it&apos;s a battle of
          focus, endurance, and courage. Every stage tests not just machine
          precision but human resolve. Whether it&apos;s the calm of a
          navigator&apos;s voice or the split-second choices of a driver,
          rallying captures what it means to face chaos and turn it into rhythm.
